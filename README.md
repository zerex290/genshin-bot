## Some info about versions

### v3.0
Latest version of code:  
• made as i think strong structure of code  
• rewrited all code in *OOP* style  
• added some fixes to functions name referring to ***PEP8*** (it was camelCase in v2.0)  

### v2.0
I tried to rewrite code and make some kind of structure:  
• rearranged code in two modules:  
> main.py  
> botMethods.py  

• switched to *functional* style programming instead of procedural  
• at this moment my code still had many of *"if-else"* case  

### v1.0
First and very bad version of my genshin bot, it was very bad:  
•code without structure arranged in *1 module*  
*• procedural* style of programming  
• large amount of *"if-else"* cases for each created command in bot
